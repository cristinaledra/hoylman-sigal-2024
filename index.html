		<p id="shortbio"> Brad Hoyman-Sigal is a Democratic New York State Senator representing the 47th district, which includes the Upper West Side, Hell’s Kitchen and Chelsea in Manhattan. He has represented Manhattan's west side since 2012 and is running for re-election on Nov. 5, 2024 against Republican candidate Emily Yuexin Miller. Here are some of his positions:</p>
		<section class="content-block">
			<h2>His top issue is the environment</h2>
			<p> On his <a href="https://www.nycvotes.org/whats-on-the-ballot/2024-state-and-federal-general-election/state-senator/?officeType=8&officelevel=2&geoAreaAbbr=47&districtID=03&boroughCode=M/" target="_blank">NYC Votes candidate profile,</a>Hoylman-Sigal listed climate as his top issue, followed by public education with support for the arts, and public safety with a focus on guns and safe streets. Hoylman-Sigal’s record suggests he believes the environment is impacted in many ways, and he has sponsored a variety of bills that affect climate in New York City. 

				<ul>
  <li>Hoylman-Sigal was a co-sponsor of the <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/S6599/" target="_blank">Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act,</a> which passed in 2019. The legislation aims to achieve 100 percent zero-emission electricity by 2040 and reduce emissions by 85 percent by 2050 statewide. The plan includes efforts to reduce New York’s spending on fossil fuels and create clean energy jobs. The act says using renewable energy, such as wind and solar, and new heating and cooling technologies will lower energy costs for New Yorkers and allow for cleaner air. </li>
  &nbsp;
  <li><a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S1856/amendment/A/" target="_blank">The Birds and Bees Protection Act,</a> which Hoylman-Sigal sponsored and Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law in December 2023, prohibits the sale, distribution or purchase of corn, soybean and wheat seeds coated with certain pesticides. The restrictions also apply to ornamental plants and turf. These pesticides have been found to have lasting harmful effects on bees, birds, and plants.</li>
  &nbsp;
  <li>Hoylman-Sigal sponsored a bill to <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S7231/amendment/A/" target="_blank">electrify the Manhattan Cruise Terminal</a>. The bill has reached the state senate finance committee, and would mandate that the Manhattan Cruise Terminal provide shore power to vessels that dock there by 2030, with exceptions for government or military vessels. Electrification would allow ships to reduce emissions by running without burning diesel-powered engines. </li>
</ul>

			<h2>He is a strong proponent of congestion pricing</h2>
			<p>
				Although the implementation of congestion pricing aims to reduce traffic in Manhattan, which proponents say would have a positive impact on air quality, Hoylman-Sigal brought forth another argument in its favor. He produced a report with Sam Schwartz (Gridlock Sam) that painted the need for congestion pricing as a life or death issue because of response times of emergency vehicles. </p>
				<p>In the report, he wrote about his experience calling 911 for a man in pain in Chelsea and waiting 37 minutes for an EMT to arrive. He also included data showing that traffic in the city’s central business district has slowed over the past decade to record lows and that emergency response times have lengthened in that time.

			<h2>He is against shelter limits for migrants</h2>
			<p>
				In an op-ed for City & State with state assemblywoman Catalina Cruz and advocate Christine Quinn, Hoylman Sigal came out against the Adams Administration’s 30- and 60-day shelter limits for migrant single adults and families, calling the policy unjustifiable and inhumane.</p> 

<p>“The idea that the 30 and 60-day rules are helping our newest arrivals ‘find their footing in New York’ is farcical,” the op-ed read. “These policies have the opposite effect, forcing migrants into a cycle of evictions that leave them in a permanent state of precarity. For families with children, moving from one shelter to another every 60 days means children miss school and switch between multiple institutions throughout the school year, leading to significant learning disruptions and psychological trauma.”

			<h2>He co-sponsored the Adult Survivors Act</h2>
			<p>
				Hoylman-Sigal and state assemblymember Linda Rosenthal sponsored the bill, which removed the statute of limitations on civil actions related to adult survivors of certain sexual offenses. Before it was signed into law in 2022, the statute of limitations was three years.

			</p>
			<p>
			Several high-profile civil cases were filed as a result of the legislation, including those against Sean “Diddy” Combs, former governor Andrew Cuomo, mayor Eric Adams, musician Axl Rose, and actors Jamie Foxx and Cuba Gooding Jr.
